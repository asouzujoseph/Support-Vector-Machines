# Support-Vector-Machines
These are the codes used for the SVM project for the Master of Bioinformatics programme. The Least Squares SVM (LSSVM) MATLAB toolkit was used in this course. 

The first exercise was on classification.
The second exercise was on function estimation and time series prediction.
The third exercise was on unsupervised learning and large scale problems.
